# Evil Corp - share the fun

There are lots of puzzles in this solution, where you only play a
small part. Unless you join us to take over the world, you know where to
send the pull requests. Muhahaha...

### The evil api

Observations is important to our goal, without them we do not know anything
about you. We want to know more about you, and this API is the core
component for that.

Details can be found at [evil-api](https://github.com/clausasbjorn/evil-corp/tree/master/evil-api/).

### The evil sensor

Delivers observations done on the raspberry pi to the api.

Details can be found at [evil-sensor](https://github.com/clausasbjorn/evil-corp/tree/master/evil-sensor/).

### The evil helper (optional)

Sometimes it is not enough to observe alone, in those cases it is nice to
help out by providing some extra information.

Details can be found at [evil-helper](https://github.com/clausasbjorn/evil-corp/tree/master/evil-helper/).

### The evil console (optional)

Tools of the trade. If you are going to be one of us, you need a black
terminal with white text scrolling over it.

Details can be found at [evil-console](https://github.com/clausasbjorn/evil-corp/tree/master/evil-console/).
